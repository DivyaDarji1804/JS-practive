----------------------quick notes -----------------
read the comment mentioned at blow of this txt and run command accordingly 
this explain how js code is executed and how it comes to stack


 js is single threaded. 


1. Global Exectution context
2. Functional Exectution context 
3. Eval Ecectution context 



in memory creation phase  memory allocated to variables
in execution phase all value are added in the variables 
and if it is function than inside it again meory creation and then execution phase 
than go back to global execution

1. global execution -> memory phase -> execution phase



---------------------- notes from comment on lec 25 ----------------------------
The working of the JavaScript works on three phases:
1. Global Execution Context
2. Memory phase / Creation phase
3. Execution phase

🔵Phase 1: Global Execution Context
The value of `this` keyword is set to Global Execution Context
(which is an empty Object in NODE environment, & window object in browser environment)

🔵Phase 2: Memory phase
During this phase, JS engine scans the code and assigns the initial values for the variables ,
 functions, etc..
 For variables they are 'undefined' and for functions they are set to their function definition

🔵Phase 3: Execution phase
After the creation phase completed, the execution phase begins where actual values of the variables are set. 
And when the functions are called it creates a new 'Function Execution' context
which consists of two phases (they works same as explained above but only for the particular function scope):
1. Memory phase 
2. Execution phase 
📝The return value of the 'Function Execution' context is passed to the Global Execution Context



function one(){
    console.log(`one`);
}

function two(){
    console.log(`two`);
}

function three(){
    console.log(`three`);
}

one();
two();
three();

function one(){
    console.log(`one`);
    two();
}

function two(){
    console.log(`two`);
three();

}

function three(){
    console.log(`three`);
}

one();
two();
three();



make snippet on chrom source then check stack  not forgot to add break points
